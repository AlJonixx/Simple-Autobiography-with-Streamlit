        My name is Aljon Rey Alipin, and I'm 24 years old. I was born on October 18, 1999, in Cebu City. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at the Cebu Institute of Technology University.

I stopped for a couple of years because of the pandemic that happened in 2020 and tried to work with my passion in digital art. While doing digital art, I also accepted commissions to earn extra income. I'm still doing digital art and hope to one day turn it into a full-time career. I want to continue sharing my artworks with the world and inspire others to pursue their passions as well.

I'm taking my last year as a BSIT student to get my degree and start working towards my dream. It may have taken me a while to get back to school, but I am determined to make it happen. It's never too late to chase your dreams and make them a reality. I have always had a passion for art, and pursuing a career in digital art has been a dream of mine since I was young. I am grateful for the opportunities that have come my way and for the support of my family and friends. With hard work and dedication, I believe that I can turn my passion into a successful career. I am excited for what the future holds and am confident that I can achieve my goals with perseverance and determination.
